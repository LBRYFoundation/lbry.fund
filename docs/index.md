## Frequently Asked Questions

Answers to your questions about the LBRY Foundation and applying for a grant

### Where does the funding for the LBRY Foundation come from?

The LBRY protocol and blockchain were created with the idea that content and information should be created and controlled by the community. Rather than do an Initial Coin Offering &#40;ICO&#41;, LBRY Inc. decided to create a pool of premined coins for community projects and development. The LBRY Foundation was granted 5 million LBC from LBRY Inc.

### What kinds of projects can I submit for grant consideration?

Applications must make use of the LBRY protocol in some form. Some ideas include building a web project, a classroom project/lesson plan, developing a mobile application, extending the LBRY Apps or services in some way, or your own creative idea using LBRY.

### Do I need to be affiliated with a non-profit organization?

No, we welcome projects from anybody, as long as they utilize and promote the LBRY protocol in some way.

### How do you decide if a proposal will be funded?

We evaluate each submission on a case by case basis. Our standards for evaluating proposals can be found on our GitHub. &#40;Coming soon&#41;

### Do you have a maximum funding limit?

Each project is reviewed on a case-by-case basis and funded based on the merits and need for the project. Reputation and previous experience of the person or team requesting funds helps determine our willingness and extent to fund a project.

### What is the process after I submit my proposal?

We review the submissions on a rolling basis and aim to reply within seven days.

### What if I have questions not answered here?

Feel free to send an email to [jon@lbry.org](mailto:jon@lbry.org) and we'll get back to you quickly.
