## Do You Love Creating Videos About The Things That Move You?

Let us help!

## We’re Making Creators’ Dreams Come True

LBRY.fund is a resource that helps creators take their ideas from the drawing board to the real world. We’re helping to fund creators who want to make top notch videos about whatever it is that they love. Take a look at some of the recent projects we’ve funded - while these two projects explain and promote LBRY, we're open to hearing pitches for all kinds of content on virtually any subject.
